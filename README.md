# vdj-recombination

Source code for the VDJ visualization used in [a VDJ recombination video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3qvfjdZs8Yc).

To run, download [Processing 3.5.4](https://processing.org/releases) and install it. In Processing 3, download the Video Export 0.2.3 library by Abe Pazos, which can be found by searching "hamoid" in File > Import Library > Add Library [(also here)](https://funprogramming.org/VideoExport-for-Processing). The library will require you to install ffmpeg, instructions for that will be given on the first time you run the program. Open ievan.pde and press play. Warning: Processing 4 will NOT work.
